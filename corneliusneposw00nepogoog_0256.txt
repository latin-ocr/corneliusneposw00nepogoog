BXERCISE ΟΝ CH. V. VI·

Artaxerxes does not' blame himself, lat sends him
written directions [to leave] this great war [aud] pro·
ceed to au inconsiderable affair. How lew there are
[Pr. Intr. 477] who is any mischance happens, blame
themselves! Datames drew upon himself the enmity
of the courtiers the more, because the king had ordered
that he should share the command [chap. 3, end] with ,
Pharnabazus. You will be in great danger, if any thing
goes wrong in Egypt, while you have the command.
There is no doubt that you will have for your bitterest

ι , enemy the man, whose advice the king principally fol-

lows. Writteu orders were sent him by the king, to
march into Cilicia with not very numerous forces.
Nothing shall hinder me from preparing the Egyptians
to restet.
