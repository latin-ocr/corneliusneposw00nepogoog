Bur little has been done to this edition save to add
r. Notes on the Lives from Epaminondas (XV), and
onwards. A Lexieon has also been added, whiehis

believed to be accurate. A Historieal and Geographi·
eal Index eompletes the additions whioh have been

made· It is proper to state that the editor of the first
edition of this work is not responsible ior the addi-
tions now made. They have been added owing to the

pressing desire· of teaohers to possess the complete
work. These additions will be found to be improve-
ments, and serve to render the work as nearly perseot
as the plan submitted permitted.
