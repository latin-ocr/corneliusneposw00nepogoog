xxti-n. Pridie calenda· Aprilis, “ the day before the cal-
enda ol April, i. e. on the 31st ol March.” Somewhat similar to the
Olympiade¹ ol the Greeks, were the Lustra ol the Romans. At the
eud ol every five years, a aeneae, or review of the people, wan made,
which was closed with a solemn sacrifice, called Lustrum. This
word, accordingly, is put lor the term ot five years—thus dno taetra,
teu years3 decem luctra uidit, he is fifty years ol age. These Lustra,
however, were not, like the Olympiade, used in rechoniug dates, but

These mouths were adapted to the course of the sun, by Julius Caesar,
with the aid ol Sosigenes, an astronomer of Alexandria, aud distribu-

dividcd iuto three parte, by Kaleuds, Nones, and Idea. The first day
waa called Kolenda (ucciando) lrorn a priest calling out to the people
that it was new moon 3 the Ides, which divided the mouth, derived
their name from the obsolete verb iduare, to divide; and the Nones

were so called because, conutiug inclusively‚ they were uine days from
the Idea The Ides generally tell on the leth ol the mouth, and the
