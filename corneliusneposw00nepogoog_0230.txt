sister, Elpinice by name. He says that 110 will not sus·
fer 1110110110 01 the tyrant to be protected by his [i. e.
the speaker’s] popularity. His duties as ambassador 010
so faithfully executed by Dion, that the tyrant’s most
cruel name is protected by his popularity. It cannot. be
denied that Dionysius is much influenced by the advice
01 Dion. How few are 111010(Ρ1. lntr. 477), who un·
dertake the post 01 ambassador with active-readiness,
and execute its duties with fidelity. Though Dionysius
was much influenced by Dion's advice, yet in this mat·
ter, his own private feeling was stronger.
