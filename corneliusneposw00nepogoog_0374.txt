Europa, chys, Europe, one of the four great continents into which the
world hasbeen divided. lt is situata between 360 and 720 of north
latitude‚ and between 10⁰ west and 650 east longitude. It extends
in length about 3300 miles, frour the rech os Lisbon in the west,
to the Uralian mountains in the east3 and iu breadth about
2350 miles from the North Cape in Laplaud to Cape Metapan,
the southern extremity of Greece. Though the smallest of the
four great divisione ol the gleba, it far surpasses thern all in politi·
cal importauce. Almest wholly situate within the temperate zone,
its elimate is peculiarly favorable to the physical and mental en-
ergies es man 3 while its numerous and extensive inland scas, fa-
cilitatingthe intercourse between its various natione, have pro-
moted their mutual progress in knowledge and civilization. It is
here, accordingly, that the human mind has approached nearest
to perfectiora. It is here that learning, seleuce, aud the arte, have
bwu most successfully cultivated; that the native freedom and
privileges of men have been most resolutely vindicated‚ aud most
generally recognised, and that goverumeuts have been estab-
lished ou the firm basis of mutual advantage to the rulers aud
the ruled. In consequence of those advantages Europe new gives
laws to the greater part of the globe; and seems destined to dif-
fuse over all the other continents the light ef knowledge, reflue-
ment, and true religion. Its ancient divisione were Scandiuaeia,
