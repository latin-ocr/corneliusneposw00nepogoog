army, dissatislied with the inactivity in which they were kept by
that able commender, took advantage of liis absence at Rome to
procare the advancement of Minatius to equal authority with the
dictator. Minutius raehly hazarded a battle with llaanibal3 aud

Mithridates, iam, king of Pontus, and the seventh of that name,
wasone of tha most accomplished aud warlihe princes that- ever
filled a throne. He was the inveterate enemy of the Romans,
of whom he ordered ennon to be massacred ia one night through-
outhis dominicas. 'I'he Mithridatio war, which continued with
few in :ervals for thirty years, isone of the most important record-
ed in the anneis of Rome. It was successively carried on by
Sylla, Muraena, Lucullus, and Pompey. The latter forced Mith-
ridates‚ alter many disasters, to takezrefuge in Scythia, where he
was meditating an invasion of Italy, in imitation of Hannibal,
when his army mutinied, and transferred the command to Phar-
naces, hisson. Seeing himself thus abandoned and betrayed by
his own children, he terminated his life by poison. Tha joy which
his death· occasioned at Rome was equal to the terror which his
arms had inspired. ’ ¹
